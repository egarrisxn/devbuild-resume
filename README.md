## Description

**DevBuild Resume** is a streamlined resume builder web application built with **Next.js**, **TailwindCSS**, **Material-Tailwind**, and **TypeScript**. It empowers users to craft professional resumes quickly and efficiently, tailored for developers who value a modern, visually appealing design.

### ðŸš¨ Important Notice on ATS Compatibility

_Please note:_ While this resume template is designed to highlight your technical skills and experience with a clean, developer-focused layout, it may not be fully optimized for Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS). Due to the use of advanced formatting and design elements, some ATS software may have difficulty parsing the content correctly.

For those seeking ATS-friendly resumes, consider simplifying the design by using standard fonts, minimal formatting, or exporting the content to a plain text or basic format that aligns with ATS requirements.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: A React framework for building server-side rendered applications.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid custom design.
- **Material-Tailwind**: A Material Design UI kit for TailwindCSS, offering pre-designed components.
- **TypeScript**: A statically typed superset of JavaScript, enhancing code maintainability and scalability.

## JSON Data and Image Upload

_Note: This feature may change in the future._

DevBuild Resume maintains flexibility by storing resume data in a separate repository, utilizing a JSON file and an images folder for content management.

- **JSON Data**: Resume content is stored in a JSON file, allowing for easy updates without directly altering the application code.
- **Image Upload**: Users can upload images to the JSON file, such as avatars or project screenshots.
