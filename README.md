## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Framework:** [Next.js 15](https://nextjs.org/) - The React Framework for Production
- **UI Library:** [React 19](https://react.dev/) - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- **Component Library:** [Material-Tailwind](https://www.material-tailwind.com/) - Material Design UI kit for Tailwind CSS
- **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A utility-first CSS framework

- **Deployment:** [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) - Platform for frontend frameworks and more

## üìÇ JSON Data Management

**DevBuild Resume** adopts a flexible approach by fetching resume data from a JSON file. This allows you to update your resume content without needing to redeploy the application.

1.  **GitHub Repository:** You'll host your resume data (the `resume.json` file and an `images` folder for your avatar) in a separate GitHub repository.
2.  **`resume.json`:** This file contains all your resume information, following the structure defined in the `public/data/template.json` file of this application.
3.  **`images` Folder:** Store any images you want to include in your resume (like your avatar) in this folder within your data repository.
4.  **GitHub Pages:** You will deploy this data repository as a static site using GitHub Pages. This will give you a public URL for your data.
5.  **API Endpoint Configuration:** Update the `src/libs/resumeAPI.ts` (or similar file) in this application with the URL of your GitHub Pages deployment.

This separation of data and application makes updating your resume incredibly easy ‚Äì just modify the `resume.json` file and push the changes to your data repository!

## üöÄ Deployment

This project is designed for easy deployment on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). The platform automatically detects the Next.js project and handles the build and deployment process seamlessly.
